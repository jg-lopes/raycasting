# Raycasting

This project represents a Raycasting assignment for the Computer Graphics course (EEL882) taught by Prof. Claudio Esperan√ßa in 2019.1. The work aims to study and implement an interactive environment to demonstrate the use of the raycasting technique. 

The project was made in Javascript with the help of the p5 library. The file p5.js refers to the library and is not of my authorship and was only included in the repository for ease of installation (more information on the p5 website - https://p5js.org/)

## Installation

To install the software, just clone the repository and open the "index.html" page in a browser that supports the p5 library.

The project was programmed and tested on the Chrome browser (version 70.0.3538.77)

## Basic functionality

The project works by using one of the 4 editing modes:

#### Standard Mode

Cursor does not interact with the screen

#### Shape Creation Mode

Click on the canvas to insert a point that will be an edge of a polygon. 

Repeat inserting a new vertex as many times as desired. 

Double-click to complete the polygon.

#### Radius Creation Mode 

Click on the canvas to position the desired origin of the ray. 

Move the mouse to the desired angle for the ray.

Click again to confirm.

#### Edit mode 

Click and drag on one of the red points that appear on the screen to modify the position of that point.

The vertex points of polygons and the origin and angle of rays can be edited.

Alternatively, click and drag on a polygon to move it.
